<h3 class="centered">Welcome to the graphical web crawler!</h3>

<p>To operate the graphical web crawler, provide the URL for the webpage you want to start searching from. Also select whether the crawler should perform a depth-first or bredth-first search.</p>

<p>For a depth-first search, the numeric limit is 100 pages. For a breadth-first search, the numeric limit is 3 levels, due to the large number of pages that may be visited on a single level.</p>

<p>Please be advised that the crawler may take some time to visit the requested number of pages or levels, especially when performing a breadth-first search. To this end, we imposed a 60 second limit on all crawler searches. If a search does not complete in this time, you will be notified and can perform another search.</p>

<p>Providing a keyword is optional. If the crawler visits a webpage that contains the keyword, the crawler will halt its search. The webpage that contained the keyword will be highlighted in the graph.</p>

<h1 class="display-1 centered">About</h1>

<p>The graphical web crawler was created by Yoav Gil, Cody Dhein, and Ryan Hong as our capstone project for CS 467 at Oregon State University.</p>
